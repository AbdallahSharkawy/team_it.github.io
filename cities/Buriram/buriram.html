        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Almost a thousand years ago, the present-day Buriram was part of the Khmer Empire. Ruins from that time attest to its destruction. The most significant of them is on an extinct volcano and is protected in the Phanom Rung Historical Park. According to inscriptions found, Buriram's ruler recognized the hegemony of the Khmer Empire's emperor. Before the ascent of Bangkok, little was known about Buriram. In the early Bangkok Period, in the early-19th century, the town originally called Muang Pae was renamed Buriram. After administrative reforms in the late 19th century, Buriram was incorporated into Siam as a province.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>Buriram is in the centre of Buriram Province. Buriram has no significant waterways. It has a creek, Huai Chorakhe Mak, the Buriram moat (or Khlong Lalom), Nong Prue, and Huai Chorakhe Mak and Huai Talat reservoirs.</p>
        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>Buriram has a football club, Buriram United F.C., which plays at Chang Arena.

            Chang International Circuit Speedway construction started in March 2013[2] and opened on 4 October 2014.[3][4] The track is an FIA Grade I certified circuit, suitable for Formula One racing,[5][6] and hosted a Japanese Super GT round in 2014. From 2018 on, the circuit will host MotoGP for the first time.[7] It also hosts rounds of the World Superbike Championship (WSBK). Other racetracks are being planned, such as a motocross circuit.<br>
            
            In 2013, Newin Chidchob, developer of the Buriram's new CIC F1 racetrack, has said that, "Buriram doesn't have the sea like Pattaya, doesn't have mountains like Chiang Mai, so we will make Buriram the city of sports."[8]</p>
